## @ Work

I'm a pediatric anesthesiologist at [New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital](https://www.nyp.org/morganstanley) and Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology at [Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/) in New York City. 

I received my MD and PhD degrees from the [Medical Scientist Training Program](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/education/mstp/) at the [Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/), and a BA from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/). A native New Yorker, I attended [Hunter College High School](https://www.hunterschools.org/high-school/high-school-welcome). 

## Not @ Work

Outside of work I dabble in choral singing with [The Cecilia Chorus of New York](http://ceciliachorusny.org/) and in running. I ran my first marathon in 2018.
